# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
 
The first step I took was to look at the code and see what was going on. I then compared the code to the tests to get a sense of what was intentioned. After that I ran the tests to confirm that the existing code worked. I then fixed the code for the tests to pass. 

What was hard about working with code you did not write?

It was formatted in a different way that I personally code with. It was also different because I didn't know the original intention behind the code so finding its purpose took longer.

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

Being able to fix the problems was easier than I originally expected it to be. I know this is because there were good tests already in place but those made it easier to edit the code and fix it.
